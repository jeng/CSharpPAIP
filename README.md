C Sharp PAIP
============

The purpose of this project is to work through the chapters of one of my
favorite books, [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming](http://norvig.com/paip.html),
by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/), using C#.

Why?  I consider C# basically a Lisp without macros, inconsistent syntax, and
too many special forms.  To prove this to myself, I'll work through the
chapters and see if static typing gets in the way, how to handle macros, and
just how extensible the language is.

- Chapter 1 is an overview of Lisp.  I'll be skipping that one.
- Chapter 2 is a simple lisp program.  Generate random English sentences 
- Chapter 3 all about lisp, mainly skipping this one.
